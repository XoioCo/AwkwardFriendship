AwkwardFriendship
=================

A very awkward way of meeting new people.

It's a very simple automated system that will randomly tweet someone a positive saying, along with a random image pulled from Flickr. 

the hashtag "#awkwardfriendship" will also be attached along with the tweet.


Code
================
The code should be considered highly unoptimized and generally very very bad. It was my first foray into [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) (which is fantastic by the way), also, this was never meant to be a completely serious project, but more of a way of trying to generate some data for a possible future visualization. 

You're welcome to take the code and do with it whatever you want. 

Please note that, in regards to node-oauth, the format of the, require statement has changed, but not has noted on their documentation. 

Before
```javascript
  require("OAuth");
```

Now
```javascript
  require("oauth");
```
